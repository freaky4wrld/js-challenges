# Vanilla UI JS Challenges
The projects made here are inspired from creater ***Brad Traversy*** github repository [vanillawebprojects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects), and are made for clearing up my fundamentals in the languages like `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS` in addition to the styling purposes I have used `SASS` for styling, which I also learned from [Brad Traversy YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia). 
All the projects made here are deployed either by using `Github Pages` or `Vercel`. In future more projects will be added and when I reach my satisfaction level with the fundamentals might compile the above projects under a deployable website.
All the solutions are made by reading Brad's very own introduction of the project and my observing the Brad's version of code, if I'm stuck somewhere.
The list goes as follows:-
